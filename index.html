            <p><strong>To Our Readers:</strong><br>
            The staff of <em>The National News</em> is proud to present a SPECIAL MEMORIAL EDITION: A PRESIDENT REMEMBERED. Published on the occasion of the first anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, it is devoted entirely to the story of his tragically brief life.</p>
    
            <p>As you can see, we begin with that dreadful day and its aftermath. To accurately recreate the atmosphere of disbelief, shock, fear, and anger that engulfed our country, we approached the headlines and articles the way a reporter of the time might have.</p>

            <p>Faithfully recalling Lincoln’s life presented a different challenge. Our staff writers traveled thousands of miles and spent countless hours interviewing those who knew him best. They have crafted a compelling story of his boyhood, youth, family life, emergence on the national political scene, and years as a leader of our nation.</p>
    
            <p>A group of equally dedicated artists contributed visually in styles that range from simple but evocative pencil sketches to the rough, marvelous modern invention, photography.</p>
    
            <p>You have in your hands the fruits of this labor of love. Throughout the year-long process, we have tried to heed Abraham Lincoln’s wise words for writers and historians:</p>

            <p><em>“Biographies, as generally written, are not only misleading but false. The author makes a wonderful hero of his subject. He magnifies his perceptions, he has vices, and suppresses his imperfections. History is not history unless it is the truth.”</em></p>
    
            <p>Our president’s life was taken at a time of new beginnings for him and for us. It was a time of renewed promise for the nation he had held together with steadfast determination, transcendent vision, and infinite compassion.</p>
